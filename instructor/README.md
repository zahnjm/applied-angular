# Applied Angular

This is the "starter" repository for the applied angular course.

## To Pull a Copy of my Code down:

Open a terminal in VS Code - make sure you are in the ` C:\Users\student\class\applied-angular>` directory -

```sh
npx gitpick -o JeffryGonzalez/angular-applied-aug-2025 instructor
```

The first time you run this, it'll ask if it's ok. Select "yes".

It will pull down EVERYTHING from my repo into a new folder in yours called "instructor".

It will overwrite what is in there.
